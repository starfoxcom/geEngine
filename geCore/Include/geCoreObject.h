 * @brief   Provides functionality for dealing with objects that need to exist
 *          on both simulation and core thread.
 *
 * Core objects provides functionality for dealing with objects that need to
 * exist on both simulation and core thread.
 * It handles cross-thread initialization, destruction as well as syncing data
 * between the two threads.
 *
 * It also provides a standardized way to initialize/destroy objects, and a way
 * to specify dependent CoreObject's. For those purposes it might also be used
 * for objects that only exist on the core thread.
 *
 * @note  geCoreThread::CoreObject is a counterpart to CoreObject that is used
 *        exclusively on the core thread. CoreObject on the other hand should
 *        be used exclusively on the simulation thread. Types that exist on
 *        both threads need to implement both of these.
 *
 * @bug     No known bugs.
