 *
 * Components represent primary logic elements in the scene. They are attached
 * to scene objects.
 *
 * You should implement some or all of update / onCreated / onInitialized /
 * onEnabled / onDisabled / onTransformChanged / onDestroyed methods to
 * implement the relevant component logic. Avoid putting logic in constructors
 * or destructors.
 *
 * Components can be in different states. These states control which of the
 * events listed above trigger:
 * - Running - Scene manager is sending out events.
 * - Paused  - Scene manager is sending out all events except per-frame
 *             update()
 * - Stopped - Scene manager is not sending out events except for
 *             onCreated / onDestroyed.
 *
 * These states can be changed globally though SceneManager and affect all
 * components. Individual components can override these states in two ways:
 * - Set the COMPONENT_FLAG::kAlwaysRun to true and the component will always
 *   stay in Running state, regardless of state set in SceneManager. This flag
 *   should be set in constructor and not change during component lifetime.
 * - If the component's parent SceneObject is inactive
 *   (SceneObject::setActive(false)), or any of his parents are inactive, then
 *   the component is considered to be in Stopped state, regardless whether the
 *   COMPONENT_FLAG::kAlwaysRun flag is set or not.
 *
 * @bug     No known bugs.
